{{workflows/planning/create-product-tech-stack}}

## Display confirmation and next step

Once you've created tech-stack.md, output the following message:

```
âœ… I have documented the product's tech stack at `agent-os/product/tech-stack.md`.

Review it to ensure all of the tech stack details are correct for this product.

You're ready to start planning a feature spec! You can do so by running `shape-spec.md` or `write-spec.md`.
