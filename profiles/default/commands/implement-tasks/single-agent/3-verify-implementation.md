Now that we've implemented all tasks in tasks.md, we must run final verifications and produce a verification report using the following MULTI-PHASE workflow:

## Workflow

### Step 1: Ensure tasks.md has been updated

{{workflows/implementation/verification/verify-tasks}}

### Step 2: Update roadmap (if applicable)

{{workflows/implementation/verification/update-roadmap}}

### Step 3: Run entire tests suite

{{workflows/implementation/verification/run-all-tests}}

### Step 4: Create final verification report

{{workflows/implementation/verification/create-verification-report}}
