Now that you have the task group(s) to be implemented, proceed with implementation by following these instructions:

{{workflows/implementation/implement-tasks}}

## Display confirmation and next step

Display a summary of what was implemented.

IF all tasks are now marked as done (with `- [x]`) in tasks.md, display this message to user:

```
All tasks have been implemented: `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/tasks.md`.

NEXT STEP ðŸ‘‰ Run `3-verify-implementation.md` to verify the implementation.
```

IF there are still tasks in tasks.md that have yet to be implemented (marked unfinished with `- [ ]`) then display this message to user:

```
Would you like to proceed with implementation of the remaining tasks in tasks.md?

If not, please specify which task group(s) to implement next.
```
