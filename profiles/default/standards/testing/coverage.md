## Test coverage best practices

- **Set Minimum Thresholds**: Establish baseline coverage requirements (e.g., 80% overall) but prioritize meaningful tests over percentages
- **Prioritize Critical Paths**: Aim for higher coverage (90%+) on business logic, authentication, and payment flows
- **Track Coverage Trends**: Monitor coverage over time to catch regressions and ensure new code is tested
- **Quality Over Quantity**: 100% coverage doesn't guarantee bug-free code; focus on testing behavior and edge cases
- **Exclude Appropriately**: Don't count generated code, test files, or configuration files against coverage metrics
