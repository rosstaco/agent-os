## Unit testing best practices

- **Test Behavior, Not Implementation**: Focus tests on what the code does, not how it does it, to reduce brittleness
- **Clear Test Names**: Use descriptive names that explain what's being tested and the expected outcome
- **Mock External Dependencies**: Isolate units by mocking databases, APIs, file systems, and other external services
- **Fast Execution**: Keep unit tests fast (milliseconds) so developers run them frequently during development
