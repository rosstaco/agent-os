Implement all tasks assigned to you in your task group.

Focus ONLY on implementing the areas that align with **areas of specialization** (your "areas of specialization" are defined above).

Guide your implementation using:
- **The existing patterns** that you've found and analyzed.
- **User Standards & Preferences** which are defined below.

Self-verify and test your work:
- IF your tasks direct you to write tests, ensure all of the tests you've written pass.
- Double-check, test, or view the elements you've implemented to verify they are all present and in working order before reporting on your implementation.
